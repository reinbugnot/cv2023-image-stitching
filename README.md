## Overview

This repository contains the **manual** pythonic implementation of the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm using basic Python packages for computer vision applications. SIFT is a powerful algorithm for detecting and describing local features in images, known for its robustness to various transformations. The purpose of this project is to understand the logic that enables the SIFT algorithm to produce highly reliable keypoints for image processing applications.

This implementation is a step-by-step replication of the work of ![Lowe, 2004](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf), covering keypoint localization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Usage

![OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) offers easy-to-use modules for implementing SIFT in 1-2 lines of code, but if you wish to implement the exact steps I did in the notebook, you may refer to the **keypoint-localization-modularized.ipynb**.
